Week 1
------

In the first week, please read the paper titled `Predicting the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins by deep learning <https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3300>`_, which introduces a deep learning method for predicting transcription factor binding.

Additionally, familiarize yourself with the basic concepts in machine learning by engaging in Python code practice. Here are specific sections to focus on:

1. Data Preprocessing, as described in `section 6.3 <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html>`_ of the ``scikit-learn`` user guide.

2. Implementation of classical machine learning models, specifically decision trees, in `section 1.10 <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html>`_ of the ``scikit-learn`` user guide.

3. Implementation of evaluation metrics to measure model performance in classification tasks, detailed in `section 3.4.2 <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html>`_ of the ``scikit-learn`` user guide.

After studying these materials, attempt to build machine learning models for a classification task using scikit-learn with the provided dataset of the Python package. Experiment with multiple machine learning models and compare their performance using the evaluation metrics.

Optional (not required):

1. If you are interested, after completing the above tasks, you can begin to explore the basics and implementation of deep learning models using ``PyTorch``. Start with the `video series by Dr. Li <https://space.bilibili.com/1567748478/channel/seriesdetail?sid=358497>`_. The initial sections should now be accessible to you.

.. note::

   You may use ChatGPT or any other artificial intelligence language model applications to assist you with these tasks. However, ensure that you understand each step of the learning process.
